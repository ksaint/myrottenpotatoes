== README

This is a tutorial setup for learning Ruby on Rails.  The majority of the
code comes from the book: [*Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile Approach
Using Cloud Computing*] by [Armando Fox] and [David Patterson].

This is not intended to be a working system... browse and use as you'd like,
but know that it's as is and without support.  Fair warning.
